Was using Techstark-opencv npm package for OPENCV JS but wanted to try building a version of opencv.js. Using android studio I found a cool function, drawMarker, which
wiil put different shapes like MARKER_CROSS ,MARKER_TILTED_CROSS,MARKER_STAR ,MARKER_DIAMOND, MARKER_SQUARE,MARKER_TRIANGLE_UP ,MARKER_TRIANGLE_DOWN
I used Windows WSL UBUNTU to buid opencv 4.8.0 but with the drawMarker function included in the opencv.js.config.py.
running npm install https://github.com/MarkDeLaFleur/opencv-js.git puts my opencv.js file into the nodemodules folder without publishing it to the NPM library.
